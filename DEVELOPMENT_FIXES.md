# Legal Cases Management System - Development Issues Fixed

## üîß Issues Resolved

### ‚úÖ **Webpack Deprecation Warnings**
**Problem**: React Scripts showing deprecation warnings for webpack dev server
**Solution**: 
- Added `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false` to `.env`
- Created `start-quiet` script in `package.json`
- Modified `electron-dev` to use quieter start

### ‚úÖ **Electron SharedImageManager Errors**
**Problem**: Electron showing SharedImageManager errors in console
**Solution**:
- Added `app.disableHardwareAcceleration()` 
- Added command line switches to reduce GPU-related errors
- Improved webPreferences configuration

### ‚úÖ **Configuration Loading Multiple Times**
**Problem**: Configuration was being loaded repeatedly causing console spam
**Solution**:
- Added configuration caching in `electron.js`
- Improved async configuration loading in `api.js`
- Reduced console logging in production mode

### ‚úÖ **Console Noise Reduction**
**Problem**: Too many warnings and logs cluttering the development console
**Solution**:
- Environment variables to suppress Node.js warnings
- Conditional console logging (only in development)
- Clean startup scripts

## üöÄ How to Use the Fixed Version

### **Method 1: Use Clean Startup Scripts**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./start-clean.sh

# Windows
start-clean.bat
```

### **Method 2: Use New NPM Script**
```bash
npm run electron-clean
```

### **Method 3: Regular Start (Now Cleaner)**
```bash
npm run electron-dev
# Now produces much less console noise
```
