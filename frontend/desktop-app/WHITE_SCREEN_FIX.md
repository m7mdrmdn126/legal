# Electron Windows Build White Screen Fix

## The Problem
Your Electron app works fine in development but shows a white screen when built for Windows. This is a common issue with several potential causes.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Router Fix (CRITICAL)
**Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter** in `src/index.js`
- BrowserRouter doesn't work with `file://` protocol in production builds
- HashRouter works correctly with local file serving

### 2. Electron Security Settings
**Updated webPreferences** in `public/electron.js`:
- Set `webSecurity: false` for production builds
- Added `allowRunningInsecureContent: true`
- This allows external resources (fonts, CDNs) to load

### 3. Better Error Handling
**Added comprehensive error logging** in `public/electron.js`:
- Console logging for debugging
- Failed load error handling
- Alternative path fallback for production

### 4. Build Configuration
**Updated package.json build settings**:
- Set `PUBLIC_URL=./` for correct asset paths
- Ensured proper file inclusion in electron-builder config

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Clean Build
```cmd
# Navigate to desktop app directory
cd frontend/desktop-app

# Clean previous builds
rmdir /s /q build
rmdir /s /q dist

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 2: Test Build Process
```cmd
# Run the debug build script
build-debug.bat
```

### Step 3: Debug the Built App
If the build still shows white screen:
```cmd
# Test with debug electron file
electron debug-build.js
```

### Step 4: Test Simple Electron App
```cmd
# Test basic electron functionality
electron test-electron.html
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: External Resources Not Loading
**Symptoms:** White screen, console errors about blocked resources
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed with webSecurity: false

### Issue 2: Routing Problems
**Symptoms:** White screen, no routing errors in console
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed with HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter

### Issue 3: File Path Issues
**Symptoms:** White screen, "Failed to load" errors
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed with proper path handling and fallbacks

### Issue 4: CSP (Content Security Policy) Blocks
**Symptoms:** Console errors about blocked inline styles/scripts
**Solution:** ✅ Fixed with security settings

## Manual Testing

1. **Open DevTools in the built app:**
   - Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I
   - Check Console tab for errors
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

2. **Test basic functionality:**
   - The debug script will automatically open DevTools
   - Look for any red error messages
   - Verify all assets are loading

3. **Check file paths:**
   - The debug script logs all paths and file existence
   - Verify build/index.html exists

## Build Commands Reference

```cmd
# Development mode
npm run electron-dev

# Build React app only
npm run build

# Build full Windows installer
npm run electron-pack-win

# Debug build with logging
npm run build && electron debug-build.js
```

## If Problems Persist

1. **Check Windows permissions:** Run build as Administrator
2. **Antivirus interference:** Temporarily disable antivirus during build
3. **Path length limits:** Ensure project path isn't too long
4. **Node.js version:** Ensure using compatible Node.js version (14-18)

## Success Indicators

✅ No white screen - app loads normally
✅ No console errors in DevTools
✅ All external resources (fonts, styles) load correctly
✅ Navigation works properly
✅ Electron APIs are accessible

The fixes implemented should resolve the white screen issue. Run the build-debug.bat script to test your build with enhanced debugging.
