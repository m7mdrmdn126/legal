# Electron Chart Rendering Fix

## Problem
Charts created with Chart.js were disappearing or rendering incorrectly when the Electron window was minimized, maximized, or resized. This is a common issue with Chart.js in Electron applications due to how the renderer process handles canvas elements during window state changes.

## Root Cause
1. **Chart.js Resize Issues**: Chart.js doesn't automatically handle resize events properly in Electron's renderer process
2. **Canvas Visibility**: Canvas elements can become invisible or lose their dimensions during window state changes
3. **Missing Event Listeners**: Electron-specific events (focus, blur, visibility changes) weren't being handled
4. **Step Size Configuration**: The original `stepSize: 1` configuration was causing performance issues with large datasets

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Chart Configuration Fixes
- **Removed `stepSize: 1`** that was causing the tick limit warnings
- **Added `maintainAspectRatio: false`** for better responsive behavior
- **Disabled animations** (`animation: { duration: 0 }`) for better Electron performance
- **Added `maxTicksLimit: 10`** to prevent too many ticks
- **Added padding** for better visual spacing

### 2. Chart References and Resize Handling
- **Added React refs** to all chart components for programmatic access
- **Created resize event handlers** for window resize, focus, blur, and visibility changes
- **Added delayed resize calls** to ensure proper timing after window state changes
- **Implemented chart resize on data updates** to handle dynamic content

### 3. Custom Hook (`useElectronChartResize`)
Created a reusable custom hook that:
- Handles all Electron-specific resize events
- Provides error handling for resize operations
- Supports multiple chart references
- Triggers resize on data dependency changes
- Includes proper cleanup of event listeners

### 4. Electron-Specific CSS (`electron-charts.css`)
Added CSS optimizations for:
- **Hardware acceleration** (`transform: translateZ(0)`)
- **Backface visibility** fixes for Electron
- **Fixed dimensions** for chart containers
- **Prevent layout shifts** during resize
- **Force canvas visibility** during state changes

### 5. Body Class Detection
Added automatic detection of Electron environment and applied `electron-app` class to body for CSS targeting.

## Files Modified

### Core Components
1. **`Dashboard.js`**
   - Added chart refs and resize handling
   - Updated chart options for Electron compatibility
   - Added CSS classes for proper styling

2. **`ReportsStatistics.js`**
   - Applied same fixes as Dashboard
   - Added refs to all chart types (Pie and Bar)
   - Updated chart configurations

### New Files Created
3. **`hooks/useElectronChartResize.js`**
   - Custom hook for handling chart resize events
   - Reusable across all components with charts
   - Includes error handling and cleanup

4. **`styles/electron-charts.css`**
   - Electron-specific CSS optimizations
   - Hardware acceleration for better performance
   - Fixed dimensions and visibility rules

### Configuration Updates
5. **`index.js`**
   - Added Electron detection and body class

## Key Improvements

### Performance
- Disabled chart animations for smoother Electron experience
- Added hardware acceleration via CSS transforms
- Implemented proper event cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Reliability
- Multiple fallback mechanisms for resize events
- Error handling in resize operations
- Proper timing with delayed execution

### Maintainability
- Centralized resize logic in custom hook
- Consistent CSS classes across components
- Clear separation of Electron-specific code

## Usage
The fixes are automatically applied when the components load. No additional configuration is needed. The charts will now:

1. **Properly resize** when the Electron window changes size
2. **Remain visible** after minimizing and restoring the window
3. **Handle focus changes** without disappearing
4. **Perform better** with large datasets
5. **Work consistently** across different Electron window states

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test window minimize/maximize cycles
2. Test window resizing while charts are visible
3. Test rapid window state changes
4. Test with large datasets to ensure no tick limit warnings
5. Test focus/blur events by switching between windows

This comprehensive fix addresses the core Chart.js-Electron compatibility issues and provides a robust foundation for chart rendering in the desktop application.
